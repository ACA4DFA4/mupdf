% Some suffixes are added through a hyphen. When hyphenating these words, a hyphen is added before the hyphen so that the line ends with a hyphen and the new line starts with a hyphen.
% Allow hyphen after a vowel if and only if there is a single consonant before next the vowel
% These combinations occur in words of foreign origin or joined words
% Allow hyphen between two consonants (if there is only two of them), except when they are at the begining of the word
% Patterns for triple consonants. There may be additions to this category, as this list is not exhaustive.
% Exceptions and single word occurence patterns for words of foreign origin i.e. Russian
