% ==========================================
% This file was first created by mechanical translation from
% GRPhyph5.tex via "elhyph-utf8 -p -c" (version 0.1 by Peter
% Heslin -- p.j.heslin at durham dot ac dot uk). Some additions
% were also made by hand.
%
% Created by Dimitrios Filippou with some ideas borrowed from
% Yannis Haralambous, Kostis Dryllerakis and Claudio Beccari.
% Mojca Miklavec adapted it for the "hyph-utf8" package.
%
% These hyphenation patterns are explained in "modern.pdf", which
% can be found in the "elhyphen" or "hyphenation-greek" package.
% Questionable patterns are marked by three question marks "???".

%%%% vowels
%-- Vowel patterns (pre-combined)
%%%% diphthogs (also known as "double vowels") and exceptions
%%%% other diphthogs: two vowels pronounced together in *one* syllable
%%%% (in some cases, the rules below will not allow the split up of
%%%% syllables in words like: >i-'on, ka-ko-poi-'oc, etc., but, better
%%%% this than mistakes like: qw-ri-'o)
% 'a"i --- not be separated: ne-r'a"ida
%%%%
%%%% consonants at the end of words
%%%% right apostrophe and consonants with right apostrophe
%%%% consonants at the beggining of words
%%%% separable double consonants
%%%% other breakable consonant combinations
% "dm" --- not separable: dm~hsic = >exhm'erwsh (>arq.)
% "dn" --- not separable: dnofer'oc = zofer'oc, skotein'oc (>arq.)
%                        Dne'iperoc = potam'oc t~hc Rws'iac
% "tl" --- not separable: tlhmws'unh = ft'wqia (>arq.)
%%%%
%%%% non-separable nasal combinations (gk, mp, nt) and some exceptions
%%%%
%%%%
%%%%
%%%%
%%%% some `weird' terminations in words of Greek and non-Greek origin
%%%%
%%%%
%%%% some weird double-consonant combinations that may occur in
%%%% words of non-greek origin like "romp-nte-s'ampr" (= robe de
%%%% chambre)
